0.1.3
=====
- 11-Sep-2002:	- Fixed a error in the autoconf/automake part of the project.
		  (scripts subdirectory was missing in the tar.gz archive.
		  This resulted in an error during ./configure - complaining
		  about non existent install-sh script)
		- startup is more silent - set initial debug level to 0
- 10-Sep-2002:	- Some (yea, I know...) -minor- docu updates
-  8-Sep-2002:	- Masquerade Contact Headers of inbound clients
		  (Contact header will be used by the remote SIP
		  user agent to directly contact the local user agent -
		  and bypassing the proxy. This of course will *not* work
		  if the local user agent is located in a private IP range.)
		- Performance optimizations in RTP proxy
		- Bugfix: now masqueraded clients work with any
		  SIP port (other than 5060). Before, incomming
		  requests/responses where always sent to port 5060.

0.1.2
=====
-  7-Sep-2002:	- Releases version 0.1.2

		  a *must* to be present in every frame)

- 26-Aug-2002:	- Optimized DNS caching
