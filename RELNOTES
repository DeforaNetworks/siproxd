Release Notes for siproxd-0.3.1
===============================

 - Fli4l OPT_SIP (still experimental) available, check
   http://home.arcor.de/jsffm/fli4l/
 - supports Linux and FreeBSD (other BSD derivates not yet tested)
 - SIP (RFC3261) Proxy for SIP based softphones hidden behind a
   masquerading firewall
 - Includes an RTP data stream proxy for *incoming* audio data
   (outgoing RTP data should be handled by IP masquerading by the firewall)
 - Port range to be used for incoming RTP traffic is configurable
   (-> easy to set up apropriate firewall rules for incoming traffic)
 - RTP proxy can handle multiple RTP streams (eg. audio + video)
   within a single SIP session.
 - Multiple local users/hosts can be masqueraded simultaneously
 - Supports running in a chroot jail (configurable)
 - Supports changing user-ID after startup (if started as root)
 - All configuration done via one simple ascii configuration file
 - Proxy Authentication for registration of local clients (User Agents)
   with individual passwords for each user
 - Logging to syslog in daemon mode
 - Access control (IP based) for incoming traffic
 - RPM support (release includes SRC rpm and binary RPMS for Redhat 6.0, 7.2)
 - works with "dial-up" conenctions (dynamic IP addresses)
 - The host part of UA registration entries can be masqueraded
   (mask_host, masked_host config items) Siemens SIP phones seem to
   need this 'feature'.

Requirements:
 - pthreads
 - glibc2 / libc5 / uClibc
 - builds with libosip>0.8.8 / libosip2
 - prebuild binaries (RPMs) require libosip2 to be installed

Currently tested on:
- Redhat 6.0 (Kernel 2.2.x, Glibc)
- Redhat 7.2 (Kernel 2.4.x, Glibc)
- SUSE 5.3 (kernel 2.0.x, libc5)
- Redhat 7.2 build against uClibc (Fli4l use)
- should run on others Linux distributions as well.
- FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE (compilation)

Reported to build on:
- OpenBSD 2.9


Reported interoperability (tested with softphones):
 - Linphone (local and remote UA) (http://www.linphone.org)
 - Kphone (local and remote UA) (http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/)
 - MSN messenger 4.6 (remote and local UA)

Known bugs:
 - with kphone 3.1 & libosip-0.*, authentication does NOT work at
   all (due to 'parse error' in libosip) - use libosip2, this works fine
