Release Notes for siproxd-0.5.0
===============================

As quite some changes have been made now, I decided to make another
release - even if some new feature are not yet completely ready,
like IPTABLES (netfilter) support in the RTP proxy.
However, it includes some important bugfixes and some other goodies.

Major changes since 0.4.2:
 - Feature: Proxy chaining - siproxd itself may now use an additional
   outbound proxy. This allows for example to chain serveal siproxd
   (cross multiple firewalls).

 - Feature: Includes *preliminary* support for IPTABLES (netfilter)
   based systems. Current restrictions: The executable 'iptables'
   must reside in /sbin/iptables. Chroot jail not working.
   Must be run as root, don't let siproxd change the UID.
   This item is stil under work, it may or may not work for you.

 - Feature: Some changes to have siproxd compile under Solaris.
   Runtime is not tested yet.

 - Fix: Bugfixes and cleanup for building of FreeBSD

 - Fix: Chroot jail did not work properly and resultet in ERRORs
   during hostname lookups (gethostbyname)

General Overview:
 - May be used as pure Outbound proxy (registration of local UAs
   to a 3rd party registrar)
 - Fli4l OPT_SIP (still experimental) available, check
   http://home.arcor.de/jsffm/fli4l/
 - supports Linux and FreeBSD (other BSD derivates not yet tested)
 - SIP (RFC3261) Proxy for SIP based softphones hidden behind a
   masquerading firewall
 - Includes an RTP data stream proxy for *incoming* audio data
   (outgoing RTP data should be handled by IP masquerading by the firewall)
 - Includes Linux/IPCHAINS support for UDP masquerading tunnels as RTP proxy
   (Kernels 2,2,x so far - 2.4.x with IPTABLES is not yet supported)
 - Port range to be used for incoming RTP traffic is configurable
   (-> easy to set up apropriate firewall rules for incoming traffic)
 - RTP proxy can handle multiple RTP streams (eg. audio + video)
   within a single SIP session.
 - Multiple local users/hosts can be masqueraded simultaneously
 - Supports running in a chroot jail and changing user-ID after startup
 - All configuration done via one simple ascii configuration file
 - Proxy Authentication for registration of local clients (User Agents)
   with individual passwords for each user
 - Logging to syslog in daemon mode
 - Access control (IP based) for incoming traffic
 - RPM package available
 - works with "dial-up" conenctions (dynamic IP addresses)
 - The host part of UA registration entries can be masqueraded
   (mask_host, masked_host config items). Some Siemens SIP phones seem to
   need this 'feature'.

Requirements:
 - pthreads (Linux)
 - glibc2 / libc5 / uClibc
 - libosip2 (libosip1 is no longer supported!)

Currently tested on:
- Redhat 6.0 (Kernel 2.2.x, Glibc)
- Redhat 7.2 (Kernel 2.4.x, Glibc)
- SUSE 5.3 (kernel 2.0.x, libc5)
- Redhat 7.2 build against uClibc
- should run on others Linux distributions as well.
- FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE (compilation)

Reported to build on:
- OpenBSD 2.9

Reported interoperability (tested with softphones):
 - Grandstream BudgeTone-100 series (only works with IPCHAINS RTP proxy)
 - Linphone (local and remote UA) (http://www.linphone.org)
 - Kphone (local and remote UA) (http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/)
 - MSN messenger 4.6 (remote and local UA)

Known bugs:
   There will be...

   If you port siproxd to a new platform or do other kinds of changes
   or bugfixes that might be of general interest, please drop me a
   line. Also if you intend to include siproxd into a distribution
   I'd be happy to get a short notice.
