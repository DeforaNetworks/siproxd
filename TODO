TODOs, in random order:
=======================

- properly handle dynamic IP addresses
  -> cyclically scan outbound interface, get IP address
     and if changed, update my internal data structures
  - adapt config file for inbound if name / outbound if name
    and figure out the ip addresses during runtime (cache and 
    renew the cache every minute or so...)
    -> get_inbout_addr(void) get_outbound_addr(void)

- automatized CVS snapshot beamed to siproxd homepage (siproxd.sourceforge.net)

- Documentation (yeah, yeah...)

- general security issues

- automagically create a proper config file during install

- get_ip_by_host: reduce DNS timeouts (seems to be a more complex problem...)

- support for "full duplex" RTP proxying

- portability to other platforms / operating systems
  first goal: other Unixes (porting to FreeBSD is queued)

- security tests for received SIP messages (function securitycheck)
