0.2.8
=====
- 24-Mar-2003:	- made compile with uClibc (see doc/FLI4L_HOWTO.txt)
- 22-Mar-2003:	- made compile on SUSE5.3 (libc5)
		- added --enable-almost-static feature switch. This will
                  build siproxd statically linked against libosip & pthreads
                  (for Flifl use)
- 16-Mar-2003:	- ERROR on unknown keywords in config file
		- introduced INFO logging

0.2.7
=====
- 15-Mar-2003:	- released 0.2.7
-  9-Mar-2003:	- replaced get_ip_by_ifname by simpler code 
		  (still to be *BSD tested)
		- removed old host-name based style for in/outbound interface
                  configuration. This is only done via interface names
                - experimental: The host part of UA registration entries
                  can be masqueraded (mask_host, masked_host config items)
                  Siemens SIP phones seem to need this 'feature'.

0.2.6
=====
- 28-Jan-2003:	- released 0.2.6
		- New Feature: RTP proxy should be able to handle multiple
		  media stream in the same session (audio + video)
- 21-Jan-2003:	- Bugfix: crash in compare_url (MSN Messenger issue)
- 19-Jan-2003:	- use of libosip-0.9.3 not possible yet -
                  libosip fails in msg_setproxy_authenticate
                  -> Bug in libosip? to be investigated!
		- give IP address in debug for 'received packet'
                - 'WARNING:proxy.c:202 request from/to unregistered UA' now
                  includes sender and destination url
- 17-Jan-2003:	- OpenBSD: do not link against gnugetopt (Luke Renn)

0.2.5a
======
-  6-Dec-2002:	- released 0.2.5a (major bugfixes)
		- Bugfix: interfaces on odd positions (the 1st , 3rd, 5th)
		  have been skipped during the search (ip by interface)
		- Bugfix: MSN messenger 4.6 caused a segfault due to
		  non supplied username in contact header during
		  registration. (Credits to Dhiraj Bhuyan for the hint)
		  Included additional tests in that area.
-  4-Dec-2002:	- fixed a major (but stupid) bug in check_vialoop. Siproxd
		  wrongly claimed to have detected a loop...

0.2.4
=====
- 23-Nov-2002:	- released 0.2.4 (feature enhancements)
		- BSD: resolved some compatibility issues (sscanf ->
		  resulted in coredump when reading config file)
		  should now build on *BSD (tested on FreeBSD 4-7)
		- inbound/outbound interfaces now can be specified
		  by their interface name - this removes the need
		  for a 'quasi' static IP and restarting siproxd at
		  change of IP address.
- 13-Nov-2002:	- working on portability - goal is building on *BSD
		  (feedback from Georg Schwarz)
0.2.3
=====
- 10-Nov-2002:  - released 0.2.3 (minor fixes)
-  9-Nov-2002:	- make install also installs a sample password file
		  (/etc/siproxd_passwd.cfg)
-  8-Nov-2002:	- string manipulations & data structures: better error
		  handling on some places.
-  2-Nov-2002:	- 'make install' install now a templace config file
		  (/etc/siproxd.conf.example)
- 24-Oct-2002:	- small docu updates in README
- 17-Oct-2002:	- fix in ./configure - abort on missing libraries

0.2.2
=====
- 12-Oct-2002:	- Released version 0.2.2
		- '-d' commandline option supersedes config file setting
		  of debug_level.
		- reworked return status from functions - now uses
		  symbolic values and is more consistent
		- added individual user passwords for authentication

0.2.1
=====
- 28-Sep-2002:	- Released version 0.2.1
- 27-Sep-2002:	- first implementation of proxy authentication (for REGISTER)
- 24-Sep-2002:	- if daemonized, log to syslog
- 22-Sep-2002:	- added access list support for registration and incoming
		  SIP packets.
- 21-Sep-2002:	- added RPM support (Spec File)

0.2.0
=====
- 17-Sep-2002:	- Released version 0.2.0
- 15-Sep-2002:	- added functionality to change user ID (drop privs)
		  after startup (configurable)
		- added optional chroot jail (configurable)

0.1.3
=====
- 11-Sep-2002:	- Fixed a error in the autoconf/automake part of the project.
		  (scripts subdirectory was missing in the tar.gz archive.
		  This resulted in an error during ./configure - complaining
		  about non existent install-sh script)
		- startup is more silent - set initial debug level to 0
- 10-Sep-2002:	- Some (yea, I know...) -minor- docu updates
-  8-Sep-2002:	- Masquerade Contact Headers of inbound clients
		  (Contact header will be used by the remote SIP
		  user agent to directly contact the local user agent -
		  and bypassing the proxy. This of course will *not* work
		  if the local user agent is located in a private IP range.)
		- Performance optimizations in RTP proxy
		- Bugfix: now masqueraded clients work with any
		  SIP port (other than 5060). Before, incoming
		  requests/responses where always sent to port 5060.

0.1.2
=====
-  7-Sep-2002:	- Released version 0.1.2
		- fixed registration concept (SIP Contact header is not
		  a *must* to be present in every frame)

		- obsoletes siproxd_conf.h

0.1.0
