Release Notes for siproxd-0.2.5
===============================
 - SIP Proxy for SIP based softphones hidden behind a masquerading firewall
 - Includes an RTP data stream proxy for *incomming* audio data
   (outgoing RTP data should be handled by IP masquerading by the firewall)
 - Port range to be used for incomming RTP traffic is configurable
   (-> easy to set up apropriate firewall rules for incomming traffic)
 - Multiple local users/hosts can be masqueraded simultaneously
 - Supports running in a chroot jail (configurable)
 - Supports changing user-ID after startup (if started as root)
 - All configuration done via one simple ascii configuration file
 - Proxy Authentication for registration of local clients (User Agents)
   with individual passwords for each user
 - Logging to syslog in Daemon mode
 - Access control (IP based) for incomming traffic
 - RPM support (release includes SRC rpm and binary RPMS for Redhat 6.0, 7.2)
 - should now works with "dial-up" conenctions (changing IP addresses)

Requirements:
 - pthreads
 - libosip 0.8.8 

Currently tested on:
- Linux 2.2.x (Redhat 6.0) and 2.4.x (Redhat 7.2), should run
  on others Linux distributions as well.
- FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE (compilation only)


Interoperability (tested with softphones):
 - Linphone (http://www.linphone.org)
 - Kphone (http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/)
