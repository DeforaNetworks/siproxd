TODOs, in random order:
=======================

- Documentation (yeah, yeah...)

- general security issues

- automagically create a proper config file during install

- get_ip_by_host: reduce DNS timeouts

- support for "full duplex" RTP proxying

- portability to other platforms / operating systems
  first goal: other Unixes (porting to FreeBSD is queued)

- security tests for received SIP messages (function securitycheck)
