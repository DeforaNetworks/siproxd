0.4.0a
======
  12-Oct-2003:	- Local registration was simply broken. Fixed.

0.4.0
=====
  11-Oct-2003:	- released 0.4.0
  08-Oct-2003:	- rtpproxy_masq: fixed an issue in port allocation
  		  which lead to syslog entries from IPCHAINS complaining
                  about 'already used connection' in the syslog.
                - added INFO() for incomming SIP Calls
  04-Oct-2003:  - Siproxd now also works as outbound proxy 'only',
                  means that local UAs may register themselfes to a
                  3rd party registrar and use siproxd only as oubound
                  proxy for masquerading purpose.
                - fixed some errors with callid handling (NULL pointers)
  24-Sep-2003:  - corrected the calling arguments of rtp_masq dummy
                  routines (non IPCHAINS capable kernels)
  22-Sep-2003:  - '\0' termination of read() SIP telegram from line

0.3.6
=====
  22-Sep-2003:  - released 0.3.6
                - Code cleanup for RTP proxy
  07-Sep-2003:  - IPCHAINS based UDP tunneling (kernel masquerading)
                  for RTP traffic (still experimental - but seems to work).
                  To activate it, just set 'rtp_proxy_enable' equal 2
                  in the config. NOTE: siproxd must then be started by
                  root (but dropping privileges works).
  05-Sep-2003:  - configure.in: test for pthreads before libosip (RH9.0)

0.3.5
=====
 30-Aug-2003:   - released 0.3.5
 20-Aug-2003:   - security tests: responses may have empty SIP URI
                  don't fail there.
                - increase size of call_id for RTP proxy table and
                  include a size check.
                - rtpproxy: cleaned up some stuff with handling of FD's

0.3.4
=====
 05-Aug-2003:   - released 0.3.4
 31-Jul-2003:   - now supports OSIP2 only (due to rather big changes
                  in the API libosip -> libosip2). Compiles cleanly w/
                  libosip2 2.0.2

0.3.3
=====
 05-Jul-2003:   - released 0.3.3
 10-May-2003:   - rewritten code in proxy_rewrite_invitation_body
                  should now work (better) with multiple media streams
 23-Apr-2003:   - FAQ updates: RTP internals
                - more debug and error testing (MOREDEBUG)
  6-Apr-2003:   - build options for FLI4L builds (libc5 & uClibc)

0.3.2
=====
 5-Apr-2003:    - released 0.3.2
 4-Apr-2003:    - introduced config option 'silence_log' - this allows
                   to control how much logging is done to syslog - 
                  logging can even completely be switched off...
 1-Apr-2003:    - should now be able to deal with an outbound interface
                  that is "temporary" DOWN (dial up internet access)
                  if outbounf IF is down, send back a response to
                  inbound UAs "408 Request Timeout".
                - always log to syslog, also when running in foreground
                - changed some WARNINGS into DEBUG statements
                - re-arranged some code
                - rtpproxy: prepared for proper thread termination on exit
                - introduced short term caching for get_ip_by_ifname
                - fixed check for socket() return status
                - fixed bug in RTP Proxy (timeout of inactive streams)
                  that produced a bunch of "ERROR:Error in close(0): Bad file
                  descriptor" errors each time a RTP stream timed out
                - fixed daemonizing (libc5) - now it properly detaches
30-May-2003:    - always log ERROR, WARNING and INFO to syslog (also
                  if not running as daemon)
                - minor corrections on ERROR printouts

0.3.1
=====
- 29-May-2003:  - released 0.3.1
                - fix in configure.in for statically linking to libosip
                - fix in rewriting SIP messages, figure out proper
                  destination if *not* rewriting the SIP URI
                - another NULL pointer related crash (no UA header present)

0.3.0
=====
- 29-May-2003:  - released 0.3.0
                - supports libosip2 (automatically detect osip1/osip2)
                - redone authentication - now should work with libosip2
                  libosip0.8.8 has a bug (fails in parse_msg)
- 28-May-2003:  - changes in rewriting SIP messages - not everything
                  is blindly rewritten now (e.g. SUBSCRIBE is NOT)
                - fixed resource leak (sockets) in get_ip_by_ifname
- 26-Mar-2003:  - Bugfix: some potential NULL pointers passed to atoi()
                  of optional fields in SIP message could lead to crash
- 23-Mar-2003:  - send 403 FORBIDDEN response to requests addressed
                  to proxy itself (-> SUBSCRIBE bug) 

0.2.8
=====
- 23-Mar-2003:  - released 0.2.8
                - made compile with uClibc (see doc/FLI4L_HOWTO.txt)
- 22-Mar-2003:  - made compile on SUSE5.3 (libc5)
                - added --enable-almost-static feature switch. This will
                  build siproxd statically linked against libosip & pthreads
                  (for Fli4l use)
- 16-Mar-2003:  - ERROR on unknown keywords in config file
                - introduced INFO logging

0.2.7
=====
- 15-Mar-2003:  - released 0.2.7
-  9-Mar-2003:  - replaced get_ip_by_ifname by simpler code 
                  (still to be *BSD tested)
                - removed old host-name based style for in/outbound interface
                  configuration. This is only done via interface names
                - experimental: The host part of UA registration entries
                  can be masqueraded (mask_host, masked_host config items)
                  Siemens SIP phones seem to need this 'feature'.

0.2.6
=====
- 28-Jan-2003:  - released 0.2.6
                - New Feature: RTP proxy should be able to handle multiple
                  media stream in the same session (audio + video)
- 21-Jan-2003:  - Bugfix: crash in compare_url (MSN Messenger issue)
- 19-Jan-2003:  - use of libosip-0.9.3 not possible yet -
                  libosip fails in msg_setproxy_authenticate
                  -> Bug in libosip? to be investigated!
                - give IP address in debug for 'received packet'
                - 'WARNING:proxy.c:202 request from/to unregistered UA' now
                  includes sender and destination url
- 17-Jan-2003:  - OpenBSD: do not link against gnugetopt (Luke Renn)

0.2.5a
======
-  6-Dec-2002:  - released 0.2.5a (major bugfixes)
                - Bugfix: interfaces on odd positions (the 1st , 3rd, 5th)
                  have been skipped during the search (ip by interface)
                - Bugfix: MSN messenger 4.6 caused a segfault due to
                  non supplied username in contact header during
                  registration. (Credits to Dhiraj Bhuyan for the hint)
                  Included additional tests in that area.
-  4-Dec-2002:  - fixed a major (but stupid) bug in check_vialoop. Siproxd
                  wrongly claimed to have detected a loop...

0.2.4
=====
- 23-Nov-2002:  - released 0.2.4 (feature enhancements)
                - BSD: resolved some compatibility issues (sscanf ->
                  resulted in coredump when reading config file)
                  should now build on *BSD (tested on FreeBSD 4-7)
                - inbound/outbound interfaces now can be specified
                  by their interface name - this removes the need
                  for a 'quasi' static IP and restarting siproxd at
                  change of IP address.
- 13-Nov-2002:  - working on portability - goal is building on *BSD
                  (feedback from Georg Schwarz)
0.2.3
=====
- 10-Nov-2002:  - released 0.2.3 (minor fixes)
-  9-Nov-2002:  - make install also installs a sample password file
                  (/etc/siproxd_passwd.cfg)
-  8-Nov-2002:  - string manipulations & data structures: better error
                  handling on some places.
-  2-Nov-2002:  - 'make install' install now a templace config file
                  (/etc/siproxd.conf.example)
- 24-Oct-2002:  - small docu updates in README
- 17-Oct-2002:  - fix in ./configure - abort on missing libraries

0.2.2
=====
- 12-Oct-2002:  - Released version 0.2.2
                - '-d' commandline option supersedes config file setting
                  of debug_level.
                - reworked return status from functions - now uses
                  symbolic values and is more consistent
                - added individual user passwords for authentication

0.2.1
=====
- 28-Sep-2002:  - Released version 0.2.1
- 27-Sep-2002:  - first implementation of proxy authentication (for REGISTER)
- 24-Sep-2002:  - if daemonized, log to syslog
- 22-Sep-2002:  - added access list support for registration and incoming
                  SIP packets.
- 21-Sep-2002:  - added RPM support (Spec File)

0.2.0
=====
- 17-Sep-2002:  - Released version 0.2.0
- 15-Sep-2002:  - added functionality to change user ID (drop privs)
                  after startup (configurable)
                - added optional chroot jail (configurable)

0.1.3
=====
- 11-Sep-2002:  - Fixed a error in the autoconf/automake part of the project.
                  (scripts subdirectory was missing in the tar.gz archive.
                  This resulted in an error during ./configure - complaining
                  about non existent install-sh script)
                - startup is more silent - set initial debug level to 0
- 10-Sep-2002:  - Some (yea, I know...) -minor- docu updates
-  8-Sep-2002:  - Masquerade Contact Headers of inbound clients
                  (Contact header will be used by the remote SIP
                  user agent to directly contact the local user agent -
                  and bypassing the proxy. This of course will *not* work
                  if the local user agent is located in a private IP range.)
                - Performance optimizations in RTP proxy
                - Bugfix: now masqueraded clients work with any
                  SIP port (other than 5060). Before, incoming
                  requests/responses where always sent to port 5060.

0.1.2
=====
-  7-Sep-2002:  - Released version 0.1.2
                - fixed registration concept (SIP Contact header is not
                  a *must* to be present in every frame)
                - Experimental RTP proxying feature (using pthreads)
- 26-Aug-2002:  - Optimized DNS caching

0.1.1
=====
- 25-Aug-2002:  - Released version 0.1.1
                - can daemonize (detach and run in background)
                - do some DNS caching
- 24-Aug-2002:  - Imlemented support for a config file,
                - obsoletes siproxd_conf.h

0.1.0
