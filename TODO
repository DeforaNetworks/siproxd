TODOs, in random order:
=======================

- kphone 3.1: authentication w/ siproxd (libosip 0.8.8, 0.9.0, libosip2)
  does not work (parse error in libosip)

- libosip >0.8.8, libosip2: failure in msg_setproxy_authenticate

- Documentation (yeah, yeah...)

- support for proxy chaining - UPNP support?

- feature: don't bind to 0.0.0.0 address, but only to inbound/outbound IF's
  (defined by IFNAME)

- multiple inbound interfaces

- general security issues
- security tests for received SIP messages (function securitycheck)

- automagically create a proper config file during install

- get_ip_by_host: reduce DNS timeouts (seems to be a more complex problem...)

- (support for "full duplex" RTP proxying) 

- via loop detection: send 482 error code

- support Record-Route header
