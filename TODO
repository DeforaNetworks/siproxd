TODOs, in anarchistic order:
============================


- re-think the registration mechanism (mapping and decision criteria
  for in- and outgoing stuff...
  
- 2.2.x kernels:
  make use of the portfw.so (ipmasqadm package) to create forwarding
  tunnels for incomming data streams
  How to determine when finished? Is it possible to keep it stateless?

- Is there a possibility to open up an masquerading tunnel by
  a userspace program on the firewall?

- logging via syslog if running in daemon mode

- get_ip_by_host: reduce DNS timeouts
