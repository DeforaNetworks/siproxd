Release Notes for siproxd-0.5.5
===============================

Major changes since 0.5.4:
 - several fixes in the SDP media rewriting part
 - use realtime scheduling for RTP proxy thread
 - PID file
 - custom firewall control module: siproxd can be linked against
   custom library  that may perform specific actions on start/stop
   of RTP streams (dynamically reconfigure firewall settings)
 - a number of enhancement in security checks

General Overview:
 - SIP (RFC3261) Proxy for SIP based softphones hidden behind a
   masquerading firewall
 - works with "dial-up" conenctions (dynamic IP addresses)
 - Multiple local users/hosts can be masqueraded simultaneously
 - Access control (IP based) for incoming traffic
 - Proxy Authentication for registration of local clients (User Agents)
   with individual passwords for each user
 - May be used as pure Outbound proxy (registration of local UAs
   to a 3rd party registrar)
 - Fli4l OPT_SIP (still experimental) available, check
   http://home.arcor.de/jsffm/fli4l/
 - supports Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris
 - Full duplex RTP data stream proxy for *incoming* and *outgoing*
   audio data - no firewall masquerading entries needed
 - Port range to be used for RTP traffic is configurable
   (-> easy to set up apropriate firewall rules for RTP traffic)
 - RTP proxy can handle multiple RTP streams (eg. audio + video)
   within a single SIP session.
 - Symmetric RTP support
 - Symmetric SIP signalling support
 - Supports running in a chroot jail and changing user-ID after startup
 - All configuration done via one simple ascii configuration file
 - Logging to syslog in daemon mode
 - RPM package support
 - The host part of UA registration entries can be masqueraded
   (mask_host, masked_host config items). Some Siemens SIP phones seem to
   need this 'feature'.

Requirements:
 - pthreads (Linux)
 - glibc2 / libc5 / uClibc
 - libosip2

Currently tested on:
- Fedora Core1 (Kernel 2.4.x, Glibc)
  This is my main development and testing environment. Other platforms
  are not extensively tested by myself.

Reported to build on:
- FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE
- OpenBSD 2.9
- Solaris2

Reported interoperability with softphones:
 - Grandstream BudgeTone-100 series
 - Linphone (local and remote UA) (http://www.linphone.org)
 - Kphone (local and remote UA) (http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/)
 - MSN messenger 4.6 (remote and local UA)
 - X-Lite (Win XP Professional)

Reported interoperability with service providers:
 - Sipphone	(http://www.sipphone.com)
 - FWD		(http://www.fwd.pulver.com)

 If you have siproxd successfully running with another SIP phone
 and/or service provider, please drop me a short note so I can update
 the list.

Known bugs:
   There will be...

If you port siproxd to a new platform or do other kinds of changes
or bugfixes that might be of general interest, please drop me a
line. Also if you intend to include siproxd into a software
distribution I'd be happy to get a short notice.
