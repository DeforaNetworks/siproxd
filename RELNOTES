Release Notes for siproxd-0.7.1
===============================

Major changes since 0.7.0:
 - Plugin API

Upgrade Notes 0.7.0 to 0.7.1:
  With the new plugin API, some configurations have changed in
  configuration file.
  - plugin_shortdial: configuration options have been renamed
    pi_shortdial_akey  -> plugin_shortdial_akey
    pi_shortdial_entry -> plugin_shortdial_entry
  - Call logging: The log_calls directive does no longer exist.
    You load plugin_logcall and get logging. You don't load it
    and don't get logging to syslog.


General Overview:
 - SIP (RFC3261) Proxy for SIP based softphones hidden behind a
   masquerading firewall
 - Support for PRACK messages (RFC3262)
 - works with "dial-up" conenctions (dynamic IP addresses)
 - Multiple local users/hosts can be masqueraded simultaneously
 - Access control (IP based) for incoming traffic
 - Proxy Authentication for registration of local clients (User Agents)
   with individual passwords for each user
 - May be used as pure Outbound proxy (registration of local UAs
   to a 3rd party registrar)
 - Fli4l OPT_SIP (still experimental) available, check
   http://home.arcor.de/jsffm/fli4l/
 - runs on various operating systems (see below)
 - Full duplex RTP data stream proxy for *incoming* and *outgoing*
   audio data - no firewall masquerading entries needed
 - Port range to be used for RTP traffic is configurable
   (-> easy to set up apropriate firewall rules for RTP traffic)
 - RTP proxy can handle multiple RTP streams (eg. audio + video)
   within a single SIP session.
 - Symmetric RTP support
 - Symmetric SIP signalling support
 - Supports running in a chroot jail and changing user-ID after startup
 - All configuration done via one simple ascii configuration file
 - Logging to syslog in daemon mode
 - RPM package
 - The host part of UA registration entries can be masqueraded
   (mask_host, masked_host config items). Some Siemens SIP phones seem to
   need this 'feature'.
 - Provider specific outbound proxies can be configured
 - Can run "in front of" a NAT router.(in the local LAN segment)
 - supports "Short-Dials"
 - configurable RFC3581 (rport) support for sent SIP packets

Requirements:
 - pthreads (Linux)
 - glibc2 / libc5 / uClibc
 - libosip2 (3.x.x)

Currently tested on:
- Fedora Core1 (Kernel 2.4.x, Glibc)
  This is my main development and testing environment. Other platforms
  are not extensively tested by myself.

Builds on (tested by dev-team or reported to build):
- Linux:	Fedora Core1
(		Fedora Core3 (x86_64 - 64 bit))*
(		WRT54g (133mhz mipsel router))*
(- FreeBSD:	FreeBSD 4.10-BETA	)*
(- OpenBSD:	OpenBSD 3.4 GENERIC#18	)*
(- SunOS:	SunOS 5.9		)*
(- Mac OS X:	Darwin 6.8		)*

* Note: As the compile farm of sourceforge.net has been discontinued our
        building test possibilities are now very limited. Currently
        no explicit testing for systems/distributions other than
        Fedora (x86 architecture) are made. We'll be looking into
        possibilities to perform some broader testing in future.
        Of course, external help will be heartly welcome :-)

 If you have siproxd successfully running with another SIP phone
 and/or service provider, please drop me a short note so I can update
 the list.

Known bugs:
   - SRV DNS records are not yet looked up, only A records
   There will be more for sure...

If you port siproxd to a new platform or do other kinds of changes
or bugfixes that might be of general interest, please drop me a
line. Also if you intend to include siproxd into a software
distribution I'd be happy to get a short notice.
