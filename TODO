TODOs, in random order:
=======================

- client authentication for registration - multiple user feature

- redo return status (make then at least DEFINED constants)

- Documentation (yeah, yeah...)

- general security issues

- automagically create a proper config file during install

- get_ip_by_host: reduce DNS timeouts

- support for "full duplex" RTP proxying

- portability to other platforms / operating systems
  first goal: other Unixes
