Release Notes for siproxd-0.4.2
===============================

 - May be used as pure Outbound proxy (registration of local UAs
   to a 3rd party registrar)
 - Fli4l OPT_SIP (still experimental) available, check
   http://home.arcor.de/jsffm/fli4l/
 - supports Linux and FreeBSD (other BSD derivates not yet tested)
 - SIP (RFC3261) Proxy for SIP based softphones hidden behind a
   masquerading firewall
 - Includes an RTP data stream proxy for *incoming* audio data
   (outgoing RTP data should be handled by IP masquerading by the firewall)
 - Includes Linux/IPCHAINS support for UDP masquerading tunnels as RTP proxy
   (Kernels 2,2,x so far - 2.4.x with IPTABLES is not yet supported)
 - Port range to be used for incoming RTP traffic is configurable
   (-> easy to set up apropriate firewall rules for incoming traffic)
 - RTP proxy can handle multiple RTP streams (eg. audio + video)
   within a single SIP session.
 - Multiple local users/hosts can be masqueraded simultaneously
 - Supports running in a chroot jail and changing user-ID after startup
 - All configuration done via one simple ascii configuration file
 - Proxy Authentication for registration of local clients (User Agents)
   with individual passwords for each user
 - Logging to syslog in daemon mode
 - Access control (IP based) for incoming traffic
 - RPM package available
 - works with "dial-up" conenctions (dynamic IP addresses)
 - The host part of UA registration entries can be masqueraded
   (mask_host, masked_host config items). Some Siemens SIP phones seem to
   need this 'feature'.

Requirements:
 - pthreads (Linux)
 - glibc2 / libc5 / uClibc
 - libosip2 (libosip1 is no longer supported!)

Currently tested on:
- Redhat 6.0 (Kernel 2.2.x, Glibc)
- Redhat 7.2 (Kernel 2.4.x, Glibc)
- SUSE 5.3 (kernel 2.0.x, libc5)
- Redhat 7.2 build against uClibc
- should run on others Linux distributions as well.
- FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE (compilation)

Reported to build on:
- OpenBSD 2.9

Reported interoperability (tested with softphones):
 - Grandstream BudgeTone-100 series (only works with IPCHAINS RTP proxy)
 - Linphone (local and remote UA) (http://www.linphone.org)
 - Kphone (local and remote UA) (http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/)
 - MSN messenger 4.6 (remote and local UA)

Known bugs:
   There will be...

   If you port siproxd to a new platform or do other kinds of changes
   or bugfixes that might be of general interest, please drop me a
   line. Also if you intend to include siproxd into a distribution
   I'd be happy to get a short notice.
