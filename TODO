TODOs, in random order:
=======================

- siproxd daemonized: looks like clashes between threads
- Daemonizing: daemon() f*** up a following pthread_create
- lost 200 ACK immediately before RTP starts...

- TERM handler

- /var/run PID file

- check via loop and private IP addresses
  can comment be used to store a unique ID in there?

- multiple inbound interfaces - do I need to be aware of inbound at all?

- Documentation (yeah, yeah...)

- support for proxy chaining - "next-hop"

- general security issues
- security tests for received SIP messages (function securitycheck)

- automagically create a proper config file during install

- get_ip_by_host: reduce DNS timeouts (seems to be a more complex problem...)

- via loop detection: send 482 error code

- support Record-Route header

- feature: don't bind to 0.0.0.0 address, but only to inbound/outbound IF's
  (defined by IFNAME)

- support for "full duplex" RTP proxying

- optional: instead of using the RTP proxy, open up UDP masquerading
  tunnels in the firewall and let the kernel do the work.
  Anyway, there seems to be an issue with some hardphones (BudgeTone-100)
  that do not work with the RTP proxy (no audio reception)

- maybe STUN support
